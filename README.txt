ABOUT FRETS
-----------

Frets is a lightweight library for creating, manipulating and printing guitar chord diagrams.

You can create chords by using a Guitar object, which can have 6, 7 or 8 strings. A Guitar also has a tuning, represented by the Tuning property. 
The Tuning is shown only when chords are printed.

Similarly, you can create chords by optionally specifying the individual strings played.
Chords also support different ChordFlags, such as PalmMute. Special strings, such as HammerDown and SlideUp can also be provided, by using the SpecialStrings class.

The FretControl user control can be used to visually create chords.
